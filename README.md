# Deploy the Neighborly App with Azure Functions

## Project Overview
In this project, I am going to build an app called "Neighborly". Neighborly is a Python Flask-powered web application that allows neighbors to post advertisements for services and products they can offer.

The Neighborly project is comprised of a front-end application that is built with the Python Flask micro framework. The application allows the user to view, create, edit, and delete the community advertisements.

The application makes direct requests to the back-end API endpoints. These are endpoints that we will also build for the server-side of the application.

You can see an example of the deployed app below.
